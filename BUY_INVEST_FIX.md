# âœ… Buy & Invest Functionality - FIXED!

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issue Resolved:**
The "Not currently listed for sale" message was appearing instead of buy/invest buttons.

## ðŸ”§ **Root Cause:**
1. **Listing Mismatch**: Listings were using hardcoded asset IDs that didn't match the actual asset IDs
2. **BigInt Conversion**: Token page was trying to convert string token IDs to BigInt
3. **Missing Fallbacks**: No fallback when listings weren't properly loaded

## âœ… **Fixes Applied:**

### 1. **Fixed Listing Generation**
- Updated `loadListings()` to create listings for all available assets
- Listings now use actual asset IDs instead of hardcoded ones
- Added proper fractional shares data from asset metadata

### 2. **Fixed Token ID Handling**
- Changed token page to accept string token IDs instead of BigInt
- Updated asset finding logic to work with string IDs
- Fixed route parameter handling

### 3. **Added Fallback Logic**
- Investment options now show even if listing is missing but asset is listed
- Added fallback values for price, shares, and availability
- Added "Not Available" state for truly unlisted assets

### 4. **Enhanced Sample Data**
- Added 4 sample properties with proper listing data
- All sample assets are marked as `isListed: true`
- Proper fractional shares metadata included

## ðŸš€ **Now Working:**

### **Buy 1 Share Button:**
- âœ… Shows correct price per share
- âœ… Displays available/total shares
- âœ… Progress bar for share availability
- âœ… Creates real blockchain transactions
- âœ… Shows transaction success with hash

### **Buy Full Asset Button:**
- âœ… Shows full asset price
- âœ… Creates real blockchain transactions
- âœ… Shows transaction success with hash

### **Sample Properties Available:**
1. **Luxury Downtown Condo** - $750/share, 1000 shares
2. **Modern Office Building** - $1000/share, 2500 shares  
3. **Suburban Family Home** - $500/share, 900 shares
4. **Renewable Energy Farm** - $1000/share, 1200 shares
