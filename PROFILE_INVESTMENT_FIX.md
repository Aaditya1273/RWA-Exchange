# ✅ Profile Investment Tracking - FIXED!

## 🎯 **Issue Resolved:**
After making investments, they weren't showing up in the user's profile page.

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**
The profile page was trying to load investments from the blockchain, but since we're using demo transactions, there were no real blockchain records to display.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented:**

### 1. **Created Investment Tracker Service**
- **Local Storage**: Tracks investments in browser localStorage
- **User-Specific**: Investments tied to wallet addresses
- **Persistent**: Data survives page refreshes and browser sessions
- **Portfolio Stats**: Calculates totals, yields, and performance

### 2. **Updated Transaction Flow**
- **After Purchase**: Investment automatically tracked locally
- **Real Data**: Uses actual asset info, prices, and transaction hashes
- **Immediate Update**: Profile shows investments instantly

### 3. **Enhanced Profile Page**
- **Real-Time Data**: Shows actual user investments
- **Portfolio Stats**: Total value, shares, average yield
- **Investment Cards**: Individual investment details
- **Auto-Refresh**: Updates when page becomes visible
- **Manual Refresh**: Button to reload investments

## 🚀 **New Investment Flow:**

### **Step 1: Make Investment**
1. User clicks "Buy 1 Share" on any property
2. Transaction executes successfully
3. Investment automatically tracked with:
   - Asset name and image
   - Shares purchased
   - Amount invested
   - Transaction hash
   - Timestamp

### **Step 2: View in Profile**
1. Navigate to Profile page
2. See portfolio statistics:
   - Total investments count
   - Total portfolio value
   - Total shares owned
   - Average yield percentage
3. View individual investment cards with:
   - Property image and name
   - Shares owned
   - Amount invested
   - Current value
   - Rental yield
   - Investment date
